# Test Document for Orchestration

This is a test document to demonstrate the Clarity AI orchestration system.

## Overview

The orchestration system intelligently routes content to specialized AI experts:

1. **Translator** - Converts content into structured form
2. **Orchestrator** - Uses LLM to decide which experts to use
3. **Experts** - Process content with specialized capabilities

## Sample Code

Here's a simple example:

```rust
fn hello_world() {
    println!("Hello from the orchestration system!");
}
```

## Tasks

When this document is processed, the orchestrator should:
- Analyze the content type (markdown document)
- Determine appropriate experts (likely Analyst for analysis, Scribe for documentation)
- Route the content accordingly
- Return results from each expert

## Expected Behavior

The system will demonstrate intelligent routing based on the content and context provided.
